Task-1

Task-2
This defines a function named write_and_append_file() that performs all the required tasks.
Sets the filename (output.txt) to be used throughout the program.
Takes user input using input().
Writes that input into output.txt.
Mode 'w' means it will overwrite any existing content in the file
Takes more user input.
Appends it to the same file (output.txt) using mode 'a', which keeps existing content and adds new data at the end.
Opens the file in read mode 'r'.
Reads and prints the entire content line by line.
Executes the function so the steps run when the script is executed.
